Forest: is a code that produces trees at random locations to make a forest.
OWLS: is a code that shows 5 lines of owls using the push and pop function and for loops that ends at the border of the designated canvas.
Pac-Man_ghost: is a code that use the push and pop function to create ghosts, the rotate function to turn some ghost -90 degrees, and uses the random function to give some ghosts randome colors whos color values are displayed.
